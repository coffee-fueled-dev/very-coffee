# Rate Limits

> Limiting RPM for your agents

The ARC-AGI API is currently free to use during its research preview. To prevent abuse and ensure fair access, we have implemented rate limits with an exponential backoff mechanism.

These limits help maintain system stability by throttling excessive requests. If you encounter rate limiting, your requests will receive a backoff response, requiring you to wait increasingly longer periods before retrying.

Rate limits are set at 600 requests per minute (RPM).

## Requesting Limit Increases

We are open to discussing increases in rate limits, particularly for researchers and teams requiring higher throughput.

If you need elevated limits, please email us at [team@arcprize.org](mailto:team@arcprize.org) with the subject line "Increase Rate Limits" to initiate a conversation.

## Navigating Rate Limits

If you've managed to hit a rate limit, you'll see a standard `429` response.

```json
{ "error": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED", "message": "rate limit has been exceeded" }
```

# Start or reset game instance

> Creates a new game session **or** resets an existing one,
> depending on the presence of `guid` in the request body:

• **Omit `guid` or set it to `null`** → start a brand-new game
instance.  
• **Provide an existing `guid`** → reset that session.

- If at least one ACTION command has been issued since the last
  level transition, only the **current level** is restarted.
- If no ACTIONs have been issued, the entire game resets.  
  Two consecutive RESETs therefore guarantee a completely fresh
  game.

The call always returns the first (or refreshed) frame of the
game state, along with updated score and win condition.

        Starts a new game session **or** resets an existing one, depending on
        whether a `guid` is supplied.

        • **No `guid` (null/empty)** → A brand-new game instance is created and
          the response will include its freshly minted `guid`.

        • **With `guid`** → The server issues a reset to that specific
          instance:
            - If at least one ACTION command has been executed in the **current
              level**, only that level is reset (typical “try again” behaviour).
            - If no ACTION commands have been executed since the last level
              transition, the entire game is reset to its initial state.

        Sending two RESET commands back-to-back therefore always yields a
        completely fresh game.

        All plays should be associated with an open scorecard via `card_id`
        so aggregated results can be tracked.

# Execute simple action 5

> This is a single-parameter command (no X/Y coordinates): the exact
> in-game effect depends on the title—for example, it might

The request must include:
• `game_id` — which game to act on  
• `guid` — the active session identifier returned from RESET

An optional `reasoning` JSON blob (≤ 16 KB) can be attached for
audit or research purposes.

A successful call returns the next visual frame(s) and updated
score/state.

# Execute complex action (requires x,y)

> Issues **ACTION 6**—a two-parameter command that supplies explicit
> X/Y coordinates—to an active game session. Common use-cases
> include “click/tap at (x,y)”, “place a tile”, or “shoot a
> projectile,” depending on the game's mechanics.

Required fields  
• `game_id` — the game to act in  
• `guid` — session identifier obtained from RESET  
• `x`,`y` — zero-based grid coordinates (0-63 inclusive)

On success the server applies the action, advances game logic to
the next stable frame, and returns that frame together with the
updated score, state, and win condition.

# Execute simple action 7

> Issues **ACTION 7** to the specified game session.  
> This is a single-parameter command (no X/Y coordinates):
> ACTION7 will always be an undo action for games that support it.

The request must include:
• `game_id` — which game to act on  
• `guid` — the active session identifier returned from RESET

An optional `reasoning` JSON blob (≤ 16 KB) can be attached for
audit or research purposes.

A successful call returns the next visual frame(s) and updated
score/state.
