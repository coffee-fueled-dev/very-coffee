One reason I really like this tkn concept is that it can work with any sequential data. I've thought a lot about how to use that feature to process and compress logs, or user events. Recently I've learned more about the challenges researchers and builders face with getting behavioral data and started exploring solutions using the tkn concept to track user events, and then create data sets from the graphs.

- Write about transition graphs and how they can be used to learn about the application UX
- Write about the training data and how anonymized labelled events could be connected to user intent and used to teach models how users accomplish goals in web apps, associated with app types
- Write about the marketplace and MCP concept
