## Welcome!

Welcome to my dev blog! So far I only have one topic, but I'll be adding more as I have time. I think I'll write mostly about random projects I've done in my freetime over the years. This is mainly an attempt to get some of those out of GitHub into the wild.

I will organize my projects into topics, and will add updates and thoughts about those projects within. Click on a topic to see the posts about it. Some posts may have embedded demos and others may just be writing. Check back in occasionally to see what's changed! I'll probably add a way to subscribe to updates at some point.
