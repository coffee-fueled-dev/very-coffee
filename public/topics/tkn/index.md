## Overview

TKN is a project focused on creating a marketplace for machine learning training data derived from user interactions with web applications. The goal is to enable:

- **Event Capture**: JavaScript SDK and analytics connectors for capturing user behavior
- **Data Compression**: Converting event sequences into symbolic tokens and Markov graphs
- **MCP Integration**: Runtime Model Context Protocol server for agent interaction
- **Privacy-First**: Anonymized data sharing with differential privacy guarantees

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Privacy-Preserving**: All data is anonymized with k-anonymity and differential privacy
- 🌐 **Universal Interface**: Works with any web application through standard event capture
- 🤖 **Agent-Ready**: MCP server endpoints for browser agents and AI copilots
- 💰 **Revenue Sharing**: Contributors receive 70% of data licensing revenue
